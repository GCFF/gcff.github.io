      <description>Intro This previous post introduces why I think the abstraction and reasoning corpus (ARC) from this paper is a worthy challenge to pursue for robust ML research. As a quick explainer, the ARC dataset is composed of tasks like this one:   An ARC Task. The top row are the starting prompts, the bottom row are the correct answers.   In this task you can produce the correct answer by: finding objects with the same shape as the object contained by the top left grey border and recoloring those objects to grey.</description>

      <description>This is not the full video TL;DR: video recording devices or apps that follow ‘a standard’, sign each frame of a video being recorded with the last frame’s signature. Video hosting platforms or news outlets can compute if they have the last frame (and wether the video has been tampered) - and surface this information to users using merkle trees
A half baked idea As an increasing amount of user generated video on platforms like Youtube, Twitter and Facebook cover current events - and become part of the ‘news’ - a significant (though certainly not new) problem arises for the viewer: can I trust this content?</description>

      <title>Why ARC?</title>

      <description>Intro In November 2019, François Chollet released a paper called &amp;ldquo;On the measure of Intelligence&amp;rdquo;. I highly recommend you read this paper if you have interest in AGI. You can very roughly split the work into two, lopsided pieces: the paper and the abstraction and reasoning corpus (ARC) dataset.
There are plenty of great discussions of the paper, among them this post and a series of videos, which I suggest you read.</description>
