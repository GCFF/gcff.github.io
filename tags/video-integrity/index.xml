      <description>This is not the full video TL;DR: video recording devices or apps that follow ‘a standard’, sign each frame of a video being recorded with the last frame’s signature. Video hosting platforms or news outlets can compute if they have the last frame (and wether the video has been tampered) - and surface this information to users using merkle trees
A half baked idea As an increasing amount of user generated video on platforms like Youtube, Twitter and Facebook cover current events - and become part of the ‘news’ - a significant (though certainly not new) problem arises for the viewer: can I trust this content?</description>
