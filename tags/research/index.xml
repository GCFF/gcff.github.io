      <description>Neurips 2022 - A wrap up post #1 Neurips 2022 has just finished - and it was a great conference! It was my first proper conference since Covid, and it was so much fun. I don&amp;rsquo;t go to Neurips to present, but rather to absorb. Over time, it has become part of my yearly calendar that I really look forward to. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to reconnect with what is happening at the edge of deep learning.</description>
