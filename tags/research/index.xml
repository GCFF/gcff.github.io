      <description>Neurips 2023 Wrap-up - Posters (main conference) Neurips 2023, held in New Orleans once again, just finished. The last part of the Neurips ritual for me, is to pool my notes and write a wrap-up (or more than one), where I can reflect over what I saw in the conference that stood out or I want to pay attention to.
In a very real way, over the past few years, Neurips has set the agenda for what I pay attention to in the field of machine learning over the following year.</description>

      <description>Neurips 2022 - A wrap up post #1 Neurips 2022 has just finished - and it was a great conference! It was my first proper conference since Covid, and it was so much fun. I don&amp;rsquo;t go to Neurips to present, but rather to absorb. Over time, it has become part of my yearly calendar that I really look forward to. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to reconnect with what is happening at the edge of deep learning.</description>
